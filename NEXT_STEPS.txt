- use REGEXP_INSTR() to search for a range of things, like /jew|semitism|semitic/
            https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/regexp.html#function_regexp-instr

        SELECT * FROM links
        WHERE REGEXP_INSTR(title,    'jew|semitic|semitism')
           OR REGEXP_INSTR(selftext, 'jew|semitic|semitism')
        ORDER BY score DESC;

        SELECT * FROM links
        WHERE REGEXP_INSTR(title,    'black|african')
           OR REGEXP_INSTR(selftext, 'black|african')
        ORDER BY score DESC;

        SELECT * FROM links
        WHERE REGEXP_INSTR(title,    'holocaust|gorillion')
           OR REGEXP_INSTR(selftext, 'holocaust|gorillion')
        ORDER BY score DESC;


======== larger chunks ========

- get the message queue up and running -- make it possible to request subreddit-fetches and
  user-fetches and such asynchronously 

    - Q4M?
    - roll my own?          (probably a terrible idea, but my needs are few)
    - https://github.com/kbenson/mysql-message-queue
    - POE::Component::MessageQueue
    - http://yaketyhack.blogspot.com/search/label/message%20queue

- start trying to make recommendations of similar users/subreddits/etc
            (requires the MQ to be somewhat working first)

- build some sort of web front-end, if for no reason than to be a read-only interface to show what
  data we've collected
